              <p> Recently I become of big fan of technology. I am doing my PhD in Physics right now. Being a scientist is pretty cool, you try to understand fundamental theories, and you could explain to your kid why rainbow has so many colors, why things appear as it is, try to think about a problem and try to answer that.</p>
              <p> But now, what make me excited the most is technology. I would like to be part of the team that build a great product for society, that make people's life better. And that's how techlogoies make our life so much different compare to the past, in a better way. Today, I'm going to discuss about 2 tech leaders that inspired me the most. Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.</p>
              <ol>
               <li>Steve Jobs: I have read book about him: "Becoming Steve Jobs". His visionary lead apple to its success as it as today. He could see what people don't see. For example, it was impossible to make a hard disk that fit into a small volume, but his team did. And the term "beautiful" come into computer industry. The design of an iphone, macbook is so perfect. I have been using my macbook for 6 years and it still works great at this moment. It's expensive compare with other computers but it worths the money. Another thing about Jobs that make me a big fan of him is his ability to persuade people. His presentation skill is so impressive. The moment he introduced iphone was unforgetable.</li>
              <li>Elon Musk: I become his fan recently. He could do out of our imagination. He involved with so many industries and he successes on these industries too. Space X, Tesla, etc. And he is so confident with his "the Boring Company", one of the guy said "it's funny", then he asked "what's funny about it". He is a real engineer guys. He builds rocket, he builds car, he digs tunnel, ect... (And he involves with Holywood too. :).) He has totally changed the way people think about electric car industry. Just think about it, it is much better than normal gas consuming car, one of the greatest thing is reducing C02.</li>
