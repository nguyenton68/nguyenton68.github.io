                When I was in senior year in high school, it was hard for me to pick a major. At that time, banking was hot, so I was not an exception, I wanted to apply for banking school, but I was lack of confidence and also I concerned about expensive tuition that would be a burden for my parent, so finally, I chose college of education (free tuition). After enrolled in chemistry for 1 month, I switched to physics.
              </p>

              <p> 
                After finished undergrad, I continue to do Phd in Physics. After 5 years in PhD, I came to a point that I needed to change major, because my husband moved to financial industry, so solution for us to be together was I would become a software engineer. One other reason is there was one time that I worked in the lab and I almost got my eye burned by strong power laser. I was scared to death after that accident. In addition, Software engineer is a very hot industry, many jobs available, literally everywhere US, Europe, Asia. 
              </p>

              <p> 
                I don’t know since when I started to idolize Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. It gave me motivation to switch. I remembered when I submitted my software engineer application to Tesla, I was so happy and dreaming one day I would met Elon in person.
              </p>

              <p> 
                This career jump was quite not easy. Mostly because my major is physics. But I spent time self-study about basic of computer science. Gosh, it was very frustrated at first, I did not have any foundation in programming. In Phd, I wrote code, but just write code so it can run and give output, and don’t care about time complexity and don’t care about data structure. The bible book that I used: cracking the coding interview. It was very helpful. Everything was so new for me from the first round of reading, but I read again and again. I practice a lot on leetcode.com website, where I used to spent most of my time to do those algorithm problems. Till now, I’m still very lame in programming.
              </p>

              <p> 
                My journey can’t go anywhere without help from friends. They gave me suggestions, instructions, one of them even spent time to go through some algorithm problems with me.  
              </p>

              <p> 
                Companies that I had online acessment: pure storage, okta, MasterCard, visa, etc. Companies that I had onsite: walmart, google, JP morgan. Companies that filter my cv based on my physics background and my GPA: amazon, bloomberg, oracle, and several hundred others.
              </p>

              <p> 
                So I started with an internship where I worked on cryptography, it was quite a very exciting field, but unfortunately I did not get return offer.
              </p>

              <p> 
                Google onsite was an unforgettable experience for me. My first time visit Google campus in mountain view. My eyes were wide-opened and filled with excitements. My first interview was a cute Japanese guy (I’m sure I’m older than him), he has terrible accent. Unfortunately, lucky angle was on vacation, so I will apply again.
              </p>

              <p> 
                After so many trials, finally, I got offer from JP Morgan. Till now, sometimes, I still don’t believe that I’m a software engineer.
