              <p> I'm the type of person who does not have a clear dream. But whenever I find something that I interested in, I will try very hard to get it.
              I was not plan to apply for grad school when I was in my undergrad. Fortunately, I was given a good chance in my senior year, that was when I decided that I want to apply for grad school. </p>

              <p> My life would have been totally different if I did not attend grad school.
              My mind would have been very "shallow" and "short". I would have never discovered the strength inside me. </p>

              <p> There was one moment during my PhD that I felt very weak, I felt I was so much behind the pack. Then one of my supervisor told me, if I could pass the qualified exam, I am smart enough, so it is not matter of you are smart or not, it is the psycologist game that someone could handle. After that I am strong again to fight with all the negative though in my head about my ability. </p>

              <p> There is no other training can be as tough as a PhD training. But what one could obtain from that is also unmeasurable. During PhD training, I learned how to think independent, how to work in a group, how to transfer knowledge and help young people and how to make myself become better. Overall, it's a way to discover yourself limit. Right now, I'm so confident to cope with anything. There is always a way to do something, just take time to figure out the way. </p>

              <p> Several key points that very important for a successfull PhD: first, your advisor, I was lucky that my advisor was very supportive, I could never finished my PhD without her. She gave me strength, she gave me a clear path and direction. Second, be active searching for solution, if you got stuck for awhile, don't hesitate to search for help. Third, be master of what you are doing. </p>

              <p> I enjoyed the project I worked on, it strengthen my quantitative skill, my problem solving skill and my coding skill as well. And I am proud to be a physicist too.</p>

              <p> I'm writting these 28 days before my thesis defense =). . . And I am making transition to my next dream.</p>
