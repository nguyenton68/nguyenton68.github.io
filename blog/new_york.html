              <p> In this post, I'm going to list some iconic places to visit in New York City. When I first moved to Jersey City (a New York City suburb), I did not like it at all, it's a noisy big city (at that time Jersey City had many constructions going on). I got an internship in midtown NYC, one block away from Grand Central. I commute to work by taking subway everyday. I was overloaded with number of people, so many people. After a while, I started to get used to it and I started to like this city.</p>
              <ol>
                <li> <b>World Trade Center (WTC)</b> 
                  <p> WTC is a buidling complex that includes 5 skyscrapers, a museum, and a memorial. This was built after it was destroyed on September 11, 2001. Next to this building, there is another buidling called "Oculus". There are many luxury shopping stores inside Oculus. Inside the buidling, sometimes they are activities open to public.</p>
                  <p> This shot was taken from Jersey City exchange place Path station.</p>

              <li> <b>Brooklyn Bridge </b>
                <p> It's within walking distance of City Hall. There is a nice spot to take good picture in Chinatown too. When you walk here, you will notice there are some shows and they might ask you to be volunteer, and don't forget to leave them some tips too. </p>

            	<p> At night, you can take a nice shot of this bridge.</p>

              <li> <b> Rockefeller Center</b>
                <p> Another complex of building include bank, Radio City, and shopping store.</p>
                <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155766193@N07/49457027742/in/dateposted-public/" title="New York"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49457027742_60a589b78c.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="New York"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

              </li>
              <li> <b>Flatiron </b>
                <p>In 1902, it was one of the tallest building in New York city. It has the shape of an iron, hence it named "Flat-iron". </p>
                <a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/155766193@N07/49456796041/in/dateposted-public/" title="New York"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49456796041_2458a2c078.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="New York"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
              </li>

              <li> 
              	<b> High line trail</b>
              	The high line is a 1.5-mile-long elevated linear park. In the middle of busy city, this trail is a quiet moment that bring you back to nature. It has many trees, flower beds, small stream. Walking along this trail, you will totally forget that you are in the middle of big city.
              </li>

              <li> <b> Chinatown</b>
                <p> There are many chinatown in New York. Places I went are in Manhattan, Flushing, East Village. One of the best chinese restaurant that I would recommend for people can handle spicy food is Szechuan Mountain House. It has nice decoration and really delicious food. You can also try Spot Dessert Bar, it famous dish is Lava Matcha.</p>
                <p> There are some beauty stores (K-beauty) in chinatown.</p>
                <p> If you want to buy loose/flat tea, they have it here.</p>
                <p> And many bobba tea stores.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            Overall, I like the city because of its diversity, variety foods, culture.
