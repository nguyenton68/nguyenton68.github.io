	<h2>Start a career in tech for a woman at beginning of 30?</h2>
	<p>
		I have been confusing myself and thinking a lot about my career path recently when my 29th birthday is coming in 2 days.
	</p>

	<p>
		Why it is so hard for a woman? At this age, you suppose to have baby (high risk if you have baby after 35) and have a family. For me, at this age, I don’t have anything because after I graduated from undergrad, I started to do my PhD, and till now, I’m still working on my PhD. This PhD ruined my life. I have no job, no family and I lost most beautiful time of a girl (twentysomething) just to dedicate my time for this SHIT PHD.
	</p>

	<p>	
		For a woman, after finishing a PhD, she will be around ~30, yah it’s too late. And it even harder if I switch from science track to technology track. Because the skill sets I obtained from PhD, only small part of it is needed in industry.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have been practicing coding and learning about algorithm, python for data science, etc … but how can I compete with other candidates in computer science major?
	</p>
	<p>
		This path is going to be hard, and it’s really hard, seriously. 
	</p>
I’m working on that …

	<h2>Fixed old macBook pro 2012</h2>

	<p>
		Recently, my computer has been really hot and the fan inside made a lot of noise. Especially when I open many apps.
	</p>
	<p>
		My hard drive is normal hard drive. So I decided to replace the normal hard drive with SSD (solid state). After replaced with the SSD, the run much faster, and I got surprised so many times, because these kind of performance never happened before.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’m really happy.
	</p>
	<p>
		But, still, it seems my computer is really old, can’t take this high speed, it’s hot sometimes though. All in all, it’s nice to have faster computer.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the way, the T6 screwdriver is not fun at all. I went to so many places to buy but can’t find (bestbuy, home depot,…) , eventually, I have to borrow from the JLab electronic group.
